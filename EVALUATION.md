Coding Challenge Evaluation
========

Overall evaluation
----
* **I couldn't generate the desired output** The file `chat_gpt_answers.txt` didn't get generated and no console error was provided either.
* The code lacks best practices (as described in Critical/Major/Minor issues below)
* **Overall the code looks FINE! ‚≠êÔ∏è**

Critical issues ‚ò£Ô∏è
---
1. The API was returning error - `{'message': "This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12677 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}` that you didn't capture anywhere and warned of it either in `main.py:24` or `chat_gpt_service.py:31` I had to add in `chat_gpt_service.py` the snippet `self.console.println(f"Error - {response_json['error']}")` to understand what was going on. This change is committed with the evaluation

Major issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
----
1. The code doesn't throw any error either on console or exit messages if the openAI connection couldn't be made because the key was absent/incorrect.
1. Too many dependencies in the requirements file for such a small challenge.
2. The dependencies are hardcoded to versions, which is OK for reliability but in your case, you've hardcoded some really old versions which broke my üíª For example you used `4.1.1` of https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/#history which is from **Feb 2022** ü•∫ 
2. The Unit Tests couldn't be executed the __standard__ way - `python3 -m unittest`
3. `console.py` is not required, usage of standard python logging library is expected - https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html
4. Doesn't use a configuration system/dotenv to get variables from the filesystem, especially OpenAI key (https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
5. No .gitignore to ignore the generated files which shouldn't be committed to the repository.

Minor issues
---
1. The code is very "Java-Like" - Usage of Repositories, Services, over-usage of Classes, static methods where pythonic modules could be sufficient. Which is __not-bad__ and __expected__ since you come from a Java environment.
2. The code is not organized in folders, even for repositories or services, since you were using that pattern. 

Open Questions

1. You mentioned you were awaiting containerization at your interview, why didn't you finally do it before submitting?
